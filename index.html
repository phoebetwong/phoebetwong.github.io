	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a Data Science Director at <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/strategy/about-ey-parthenon" target="_blank">EY-Parthenon</a>, where I recently completed a NASA SBIR Phase II contract to develop real-time geomagnetically induced currents forecasting capabilities with Deep Learning techniques, which aimed to mitigate risks that extreme geomagnetic storms posed to electric power systems. In Oct 2022, I gave a talk on this project at the <a href="https://www.aielectricpower.com/" target="_blank">EPRI AI & Electric Power Summit</a> (my presentation is posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985728300673368065/" target="_blank">here</a>).
		<br><br>
		Previously, I was the Senior Director of Data Science & Analytics at the <a href="https://www.voterparticipation.org/" target="_blank">Voter Participation Center</a>. I developed and managed data science and analytics projects to optimize the results of VPC's large-scale voter registration and turnout programs, with the goal of increasing civic participation of historically underrepresented groups in the U.S. In the 2020 cycle, VPC's programs sent out 360 million pieces of direct mail, which generated 1.6 million voter registrations and close to 5 million vote-by-mail applications in battleground states.
		<br><br>
		From 2017 to 2019, I built and ran a nonprofit called <a href="https://equalcitizens.us/" target="_blank">Equal Citizens</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank">Prof. Lawrence Lessig</a> at Harvard Law School.
		Equal Citizens advances democracy reform in the U.S. through a variety of projects, including election reform litigations, grassroot mobilization,
		and education campaigns. In July 2020, Supreme Court ruled on the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/supreme-court-rules-states-can-punish-faithless-electors/" target="_blank"> "faithless electors"</a> case filed by Equal Citizens, and another <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2019/11/04/judge-says-alaska-should-crack-down-on-unlimited-contributions-in-state-elections/" target="_blank">case</a> challenging the constitutionality of Super PACs is making its way to the Court.
		<br><br>
		Before that, I was a senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress, where I advised Members of Congress and staffers on macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary policy issues.
		<br><br>
		And before that, I was a consultant at the World Bank, where I contributed to macro, fiscal, and economic development policy research in the Europe and Central Asia and Latin America regions.
		<br><br>
		I'm passionate about enabling evidence-based decision making and creating values for end users with data. To those ends, I try to publish blog posts on data science topics as often as I can. You can find my latest work <a href="https://phoebetwong.github.io/mylatestwork.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.
		<br><br>
		In 2021, I completed the <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program" target="_blank">Stanford Professional Certificate in Artificial Intelligence</a>, focusing on Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning.
