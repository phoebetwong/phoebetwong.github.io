	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently the Director of Data Science & Analytics at the <a href="https://www.voterparticipation.org/" target="_blank">Voter Participation Center</a>. I manage and execute data science and analytics projects to improve the results of VPC's large-scale voter registration and turnout programs, with the goal of increasing civic participation of historically underrepresented groups in the U.S. In the 2020 cycle, VPC's programs have generated 1.6 million voter registrations and over 5 million vote-by-mail applications.
		<br><br>
		Beyond civic engagement, I'm passionate about promoting data science literacy and enabling evidence-based decision making with data. To those ends, I try to publish blog posts on data science topics as often as I can. You can find my latest posts <a href="https://phoebetwong.github.io/mylatestwork.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.
		<br><br>
		Before joining VPC, I completed the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/dc" target="_blank">Data Science Fellowship at Flatiron School DC</a>,
		where I learned the latest and greatest machine learning and deep learning models with Python. I also went outside the standard data science curriculum and learned how to implement machine learning techniques to make causal inferences.
		<br><br>
		From 2017-2019, I built and ran a nonprofit called <a href="https://equalcitizens.us/" target="_blank">Equal Citizens</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank">Prof. Lawrence Lessig</a> at Harvard Law School.
		Equal Citizens advances democracy reform in the U.S. through a variety of projects, including election reform litigations, grassroot mobilization,
		and education campaigns. In July 2020, Supreme Court ruled on the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/supreme-court-rules-states-can-punish-faithless-electors/" target="_blank"> "faithless electors"</a> case filed by Equal Citizens, and another <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2019/11/04/judge-says-alaska-should-crack-down-on-unlimited-contributions-in-state-elections/" target="_blank">case</a> challenging the constitutionality of Super PACs is making its way to the Court.
		<br><br>
		Previously, I was a senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress, where I advised Members of Congress and
		staffers on macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary policy issues.
		<br><br>
		Before that, I was a consultant at the World Bank, where I contributed to macro, fiscal, and economic development policy research in the Europe and Central Asia and Latin America regions.
