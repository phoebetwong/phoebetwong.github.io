	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/" target="_blank">American University Department of Economics</a>. My dissertation focuses on how special interest influence
		affects fiscal policies.
		<br><br>
    In Sep 2019, I completed the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/dc" target="_blank">Data Science Fellowship at Flatiron School DC</a>,
    where I learned the latest and greatest machine learning and deep learning models with Python. I also went outside the standard data science curriculum and learned how to implement machine learning techniques to make causal inferences, specifically using several
    models built by <a href=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/susan-athey" target="_blank">Susan Athey</a> at Stanford in one of the chapters of my dissertation.
    <br><br>
		I spent the last 2+ years building and running a nonprofit called <a href="https://equalcitizens.us/" target="_blank">Equal Citizens</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank">Prof. Lawrence Lessig</a> at Harvard Law School.
		Equal Citizens advances democracy reform in the U.S. through a variety of projects including election reform litigations, grassroot mobilization,
		and education campaigns. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/politics/electoral-college-faithless-elector.html" target="_blank">One of our cases</a> will most likely be reviewed by the Supreme Court before the 2020 election!
		<br><br>
		Previously, I was a senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress, where I advised Members of Congress and
		staffers on macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary policy issues.
		<br><br>
		Before that, I was a consultant at the World Bank, where I contributed to macro, fiscal, and economic development policy research in the Europe and Central Asia and Latin America regions.
