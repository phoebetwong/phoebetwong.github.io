## Applied AI & Data Science Projects
---
- Fine-tuned NVIDIA Riva streaming ASR in es-ES with domain-specific audios and corpora, and reduced the word error rate of the existing model in production by 10 percentage points.
- Developed a first-of-its-kind time series forecasting solution to predict hazardous GIC events with deep learning techniques using a data-centric AI approach, focusing on data quality control throughout the MLOps lifecycle to maintain model accuracy post-deployment.
- Developed and deployed an application to speed up random assignments in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with multiple treatments across time and large sample sizes by leveraging parallel computing and MPP databases. Reduced processing time for random assignments of 40MM samples from 48+ hours to ~15 minutes.
- Developed and deployed a voter registration likelihood model using XGBoost, with over 5MM records and 300 features. Successful registration rates increased 2x after model deployment.
- Developed an uplift model to predict targets’ net responsiveness to voter turnout outreach, using 10MM records from past RCTs to infer actual treatment effects based on estimated counterfactual behavior.
