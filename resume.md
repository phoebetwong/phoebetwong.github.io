## Data Science Projects
---
- Analyze the social media posts of candidates in 2020 US federal/state-wide elections to detect differences in word choices and sentiments on salient topics and improve the accuracy of 2022 electoral predictions.
- Predicted successful registration likelihood of targets using an XGBoost model with over 5M records from past voter registration programs and 300 features. Successful registration rates doubled after model deployment.
- Designed an optimization algorithm that assigned treatment intensity to targets in an address-based voter registration program based on modeled registration rates and ideology composition of US Census Block Groups. Raised the program’s reach to intended target audience from 60% to 80%.
- Built a “true-lift” model that incorporates both predicted treatment effect and counterfactual behavior to predict targets’ net responsiveness to voter turnout outreach, using 10M records from past RCTs.    
- Estimated the causal effects of policy interventions using machine learning enhanced synthetic control method, matrix completion, causal forest, ensemble method, and recurrent neural networks.
