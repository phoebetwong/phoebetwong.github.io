## Data Science Projects
---
-	Predicted successful registrants of voter registration programs using an XGBoost model with over 5MM person-level past program records and 300 features. Response rates of subsequent programs doubled.
- Designed an optimization algorithm to assign number of mail pieces to 8MM targets in an address-based direct mail program based on modeled registration rates and ideology composition at the census block group level.
- Rank-ordered 2020 general election voters by their net responsiveness to voter turnout efforts using the “true-lift” model approach that incorporates both predicted treatment effect and counterfactual behavior, trained with 10MM records from past randomized controlled experiments.    
- Built classification models that predict the winning party of congressional races from 2014 to 2018 using past election results and demographic features from U.S. Census data, with over 98 percent accuracy.
- Estimated the causal effects of policy interventions using machine learning enhanced synthetic control method, matrix completion, causal forest, ensemble method, and recurrent neural networks.
