	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD candidate at the econ department at American University. My dissertation focuses on how special interest influence
		affects fiscal policies.
		<br><br>
		I spent the last two years building and running a nonprofit called Equal Citizens with Prof. Lawrence Lessig at Harvard Law School.
		Equal Citizens advances democracy reform in the US through a variety of projects: election reform litigations, grassroot mobilization,
		and education campaigns.
		<br><br>
		Previously, I was a senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress, where I advised Members of Congress and
		staffers on macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary policy issues.
		<br><br>
		Before that, I was a consultant at the World Bank.
